changes:
  - rscdel: removes the virologist role. this is config based.
  - rscdel: Removes most means to customize viruses This is config based. Currently,
      you can remove up to 2 symptoms from a disease, neuter symptoms, and mix viruses.
      Symptom removal is not random, with each symptom being removed based on a value
      given at roundstart.
  - rscdel: dermagraphic ovulogenesis symptom
  - tweak: while virus customization is disabled, virus sample crates instead ship
      5 isolated utility symptoms
  - rscadd: re-adds viro zombies. They're now weaker, and only spread their diseases,
      instead of spreading the tumor itself.
  - rscadd: adds a new chemical reaction, which allows you to remove faltered, immutable,
      dormant, and carrier status from viruses
  - balance: random viruses made through events should be more impactful now
  - balance: some symptom thresholds should be far easier to reach. config controlled.
  - tweak: toxoplasmosis sapiens is now level 0, and can *technically* appear, but,
      like all level 0 symptoms, will practically never appear, and will be even less
      likely to have any significant effect. However, the owo speak effect has been
      substantially toned down, and should now only impede the speech of certain letters
      and induce random cat noises, rather than replacing words arbitrarily.
