      ugraded and takes time to scan people.
  - balance: All medical scans now do slight radiation damage depending on the scanner
      used.

      be the only handheld analyzer at shift start, same as the advanced one.
  - balance: removed advanced analyzer from the techtree and made them admin-only.
      Moved the normal one to tier 5 and research disk exclusive.
