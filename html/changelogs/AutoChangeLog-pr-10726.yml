changes:
  - rscadd: A new kitchen machine, the griddle, for cooking your meats on!
  - rscadd: remapped kitchens to support new machine
  - tweak: Most meats are cooked through the griddle, rather than microwaving. Not
      following this will lead to your meat just producing a burnt mess when you microwave
      it.
  - tweak: burgers are now made with meat patties. These patties can be made by rolling
      a meatball.
  - rscadd: patty sprites, new meatballs sprites, new sausage sprites, griddle sprites,
      steam animation
  - balance: Upgrading the food processor actually works.
  - code_imp: Added check to prevent mindless runtime when cluwning mob
  - bugfix: Grills now grill food, not reagent containers
