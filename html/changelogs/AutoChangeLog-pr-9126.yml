delete-after: true
changes:
  - rscadd: Added a backstory selection system for Traitors, allowing easier determination
      of the roleplay motivations behind a traitor.
  - code_imp: Cleaned up traitor objective generation and split AI vs human traitors
      into their own files.
  - tweak: Changed how murderbone is determined for traitors. It no longer depends
      directly on your objectives, but instead informs your objectives. As a consequence,
      lowered the 'base' probability to match the previous overall probability.
  - bugfix: Fixes a bug from when soft-tracked objectives were added, it accidentally
      lowered the rate of murderbone traitors. This has been corrected.
  - rscadd: Enabled the 'neutral' theme for emagged ModPCs, for use by non-syndicate
      traitors.
  - admin: Added traitor faction and backstory display to Traitor Panel. Added logging
      for faction/backstory selection.
