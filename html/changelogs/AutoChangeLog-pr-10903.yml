changes:
  - refactor: Standardized the entire attack_chain and added stack_traces to detect
      when & where it fails.
  - balance: minor buff to telekinesis to use most interact() code. Unlikely to cause
      major change, just reducing duplicate code where TK would have its own proc
      for essentially doing the exact same thing
